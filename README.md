# PhishingGraph

PhishingGraph is a methodology of utilizing machine learnig chatbots (particularly ChatGPT) to analyze social engineering threats.  In particular, PhishingGraph addresses human weaknesses and points out red flags in the messages under analysis.

PhishingGraph was born of out Levi Seibert's Master's Thesis, and that document, along with a conference paper explaining the methodolgy, are currently in review.

This project contains three Proof-Of-Concept Applications, each of which utilize the ChatGPT API (you will need to get your own API key; see https://openai.com/product).

## PhishingGraph-Text
PhishingGraph-Text is the simpliest of the the POCs, as it only evalutes simple text documents.  To utilize this chatbotcopy the text of an email to a .txt file and save in the same directory as PhishingGraph-Text.py.  To execute the application, run "python PhishingGraph-Text.py" from the command line, followed by the name of the text file.
